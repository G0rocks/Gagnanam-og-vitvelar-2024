Looking at the plots the predictions seem to be seperated into 3 groups.
        That or the data is in 3 groups since around the first 50 data points are very precisely predicted.
        From 50 to 100 the predictions get much worse and from 100 to 150 the data points are not really well
        predicted. Not sure what to make of that but it is very strange.
